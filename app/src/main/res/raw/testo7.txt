Pour out the bottle, I wanna level up (level up)
When I'm with you, I nevеr get enough (get еnough)
Slow whine I'm not in a rush
I can hear music when you're here
Tonight, we're rolling, party 'til closing
Since I put the ring on her finger, it's still frozen
Love in slow motion
I wanna feel you over me, yeah
Somethin' magic in your eyes, yeah
Girl, I love the way you ride it
And it happens every time you arrive, that's right
Girl, I want you in my life (yeah)
If there's a heaven, then it's right here
I will never leave your side, stay, tonight, tonight
When you wan' see me, when you wan' see me
I'm in West London this evening
Givin' me the feelings, no I'm not leavin'
Until I fly LA next weekend (next weekend)
Peru, nah, girl, I'd rather go find somewhere quiet
You'll glow, and I'll get lost here in your eyes

Omoge no be so
